[Input]
# Choose a set of value(s) of forcing variables to be processed for
# WRF-Hydro. Please be advised that the order of which the values are
# chosen below are the order that the final products will be layered
# into the final LDASIN files. See documentation for additional
# information and examples.
# The following is a global set of key values to map forcing files
# to variables within LDASIN files for WRF-Hydro. The forcing engine
# will map files to external variable names internally. For custom
# external native forcing files (see documenation), the code will
# expect a set of named variables to process. The following is a
# mapping of numeric values to external input native forcing files:
# 1 - NLDAS GRIB retrospective files
# 2 - NARR GRIB retrospective files
