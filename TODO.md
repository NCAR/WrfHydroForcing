Remaining To-Do Tasks for the MFE:

* Move all inline Params into separate configuration files (`.py` or JSON)
* Factor out repeated caught-exception tuples into constants (project-wide?)
* Factor out duplicated algorithms into regridding/bias-correction objects
* Refactor the repeated read/check/error pattern in config.read_config()
* Clean up error pattern
* Use enums where appropriate instead of dictionaries
