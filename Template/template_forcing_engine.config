#     for input files.
# 3.) Choices for ESMF regridding techniques.
# 4.) Choices for optional downscaling techniques.

[Input]
# Choose a set of value(s) of forcing variables to be processed for
# WRF-Hydro. Please be advised that the order of which the values are
# chosen below are the order that the final products will be layered
# into the final LDASIN files. See documentation for additional
# information and examples.
# The following is a global set of key values to map forcing files
# to variables within LDASIN files for WRF-Hydro. The forcing engine
# will map files to external variable names internally. For custom
# external native forcing files (see documenation), the code will
# expect a set of named variables to process. The following is a
# mapping of numeric values to external input native forcing files:
# 1 - NLDAS GRIB retrospective files
# 2 - NARR GRIB retrospective files
# 3 - GFS GRIB2 Global production files on the full gaussian grid
# 4 - NAM Nest GRIB2 Conus production files
# 5 - HRRR GRIB2 Conus production files
# 6 - RAP GRIB2 Conus production files
# 7 - CFS GRIB2 Global production files
# 8 - WRF-ARW - GRIB2 Hawaii nest files
# 9 - GFS GRIB2 Global production files on 0.25 degree lat/lon grids. 
# 10 - Custom NetCDF forcing files

# Specify the input directories for each forcing product.
InputForcingDirectories = /Users/karsten/Desktop/testCase/GFS

[Output]
# Specify the output frequency in minutes. 
# Note that any frequencies at higher intervals
# than what is provided as input will entail input
# forcing data being temporally interpolated.
OutputFrequency = 60

# Specify a top level output directory. For re-forecasts
# and forecasts, sub-directories for each forecast cycle
# will be generated. For retrospective processing, final
# output files will be placed in this directory. 
OutDir = /Users/karsten/Desktop/FORCING_TEST

# Specify a scratch directory that will be used 
# for storage of temporary files. These files
# will be removed automatically by the program. 
ScratchDir = /Users/karsten/Desktop/FORCING_TEST/SCRATCH

[Retrospective]
# Specify to process forcings in retrosective mode
# 0 - No
# 1 - Yes
RetroFlag = 0

# Choose the beginning date of processing forcing files.
# NOTE - Dates are given in YYYYMMDDHHMM format
# If in real-time forecasting mode, leave as -9999.
# These dates get over-ridden in lookBackHours.

EDateProc = 201810020000

[Forecast]
# ONLY for realtime forecasting.
# - Specify a lookback period in minutes to process data.
#   This overrides any BDateProc/EDateProc options passed above.
#   If no LookBack specified, please specify -9999.

# If running reforecasts, specify a window below. This will override

# Specify a forecast frequency in minutes. This value specifies how often
# to generate a set of forecast forcings. If generating hourly retrospective
# forcings, specify this value to be 60. 
ForecastFrequency = 1440

# Forecast cycles are determined by splitting up a day by equal 
# ForecastFrequency interval. If there is a desire to shift the
# cycles to a different time step, ForecastShift will shift forecast
# cycles ahead by a determined set of minutes. For example, ForecastFrequency
# of 6 hours will produce forecasts cycles at 00, 06, 12, and 18 UTC. However,
# a ForecastShift of 1 hour will produce forecast cycles at 01, 07,
# 13, and 18 UTC. NOTE - This is only used by the realtime instance 
# to calculate forecast cycles accordingly. Re-forecasts will use the beginning
# and ending dates specified in conjunction with the forecast frequency
# to determine forecast cycle dates.

# forecast cycle. See documentation for examples. The length of

# This option is for applying an offset to input forcings to use a different
# forecasted interval. For example, a user may wish to use 4-5 hour forecasted
# fields from an NWP grid from one of their input forcings. In that instance
# the offset would be 4 hours, but 0 for other remaining forcings.

# NOTE - All input options here must be of the same length
