# WRF-Hydro Forcing Engine Configuration File

# Input options to the forcing engine include:
# 1.) Choices for input forcing files to use.
# 2.) Options for specifying date ranges and forecast intervals
#     for input files.
# 3.) Choices for ESMF regridding techniques.
# 4.) Choices for optional downscaling techniques.
# 5.) Choices for optional bias correction techniques.
# 6.) Choices for optional supplemental precipitation products.
# 7.) Choices for optional ensemble member variations.
# 8.) Choices for output directories to place final output files.

[Input]
# Choose a set of value(s) of forcing variables to be processed for
# WRF-Hydro. Please be advised that the order of which the values are
# chosen below are the order that the final products will be layered
# into the final LDASIN files. See documentation for additional
# information and examples.
# The following is a global set of key values to map forcing files
# to variables within LDASIN files for WRF-Hydro. The forcing engine
# will map files to external variable names internally. For custom
# external native forcing files (see documenation), the code will
# expect a set of named variables to process. The following is a
# mapping of numeric values to external input native forcing files:
# 1 - NLDAS GRIB retrospective files
# 2 - NARR GRIB retrospective files
# 3 - GFS GRIB2 Global production files
# 4 - NAM Nest GRIB2 Conus production files
# 5 - HRRR GRIB2 Conus production files
# 6 - RAP GRIB2 Conus production files
# 7 - CFS GRIB2 Global production files
# 8 - WRF-ARW - GRIB2 Hawaii nest files
# 9 - Custom NetCDF forcing files
# 10 - Custom GRIB2 files
InputForcings = [5,6]

[Logistics]
# Choose the beginning date of processing forcing files.
# NOTE - Dates are given in YYYYMMDDHH format
BDateProc = 2018100100
EDateProc = 2018120100

# ONLY FOR NWM - Specify a lookback period to process data.
# This overrides any BDateProc/EDateProc options passed above.
LookBackHours = 740

# Specify forecast intervals to use from each input option. For example,
# if the forcing engine is being ran in retrospective mode, and all input
# forcings are on an hourly timestep, then all input forecast intervals
# will be 1. If 1 is chosen for all ForecastIntervals, then the forcing engine
# code will recognize this as processing for a retrosective simulation.
# However, if only 6-hour forecasts from inputs will be used,
# then the forecast intervals will be 6. The forcing engine code will know
# to use 6-hour forecasts for each input product to fill in 6-hour gaps.
# NOTE!!!! - The largest forecast interval will be used as the common denominator
#            For processing cycles. For example, for a layering of HRRR and GFS,
#            if a forecast cycle is specified at 240 hours for GFS, and 18 hours for
#            HRRR, then InputForcings = [3,5] and ForecastIntervals = [240,18].
# NOTE!!!! - The forcing engine code maps input forcings to their expected forecast
#            cycle output frequency. This means for any hours being processed inside
#            a range of hours where output is available, values, will be temporally
#            interpolated.
ForecastIntervals = [18,18]

# Specify a geogrid file that defines the WRF-Hydro (or NWM) domain to which
# the forcings are being processed to.
geogridIn = /blah/blah/geo_em.nc

[Regridding]
# Choose regridding options for each input forcing files being used. Options available are:
# 1 - ESMF Bilinear
# 2 - ESMF Nearest Neighbor
# 3 - ESMF Conservative Bilinear
RegridOpt = [1,1]

[Downscaling]
# Choose downscaling options for each of the input forcing files. Downscaling options include:
# FILL IN DOWNSCALING OPTIONS HERE.....

# Specify the input parameter directory containing necessary downscaling grids.
DownscalingParamDir = /blah/blah

[BiasCorrection]
# Choose bias correction for each of the input forcing files. Bias correction options include:
# FILL IN BIAS CORRECTION HERE.....

[SuppForcing]
# Choose a set of supplemental precipitation file(s) to layer
# into the final LDASIN forcing files processed from
# the options above. The following is a mapping of
# numeric values to external input native forcing files:
# 1 - MRMS GRIB2 hourly radar-only QPE
# 2 - MRMS GRIB2 hourly gage-corrected radar QPE
# 3 - Stage IV hourly MPE
# 4 - Hourly National Water Model MPE NetCDF files.
# 5 - Custom hourly NetCDF MPE files
# 6 - Custom hourly GRIB2 MPE files

[Ensembles]
# Choose ensemble options for each input forcing file being used. Ensemble options include:
