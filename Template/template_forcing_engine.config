# 3.) Choices for ESMF regridding techniques.
# 4.) Choices for optional downscaling techniques.

[Input]
# Choose a set of value(s) of forcing variables to be processed for
# WRF-Hydro. Please be advised that the order of which the values are
# chosen below are the order that the final products will be layered
# into the final LDASIN files. See documentation for additional
# information and examples.
# The following is a global set of key values to map forcing files
# to variables within LDASIN files for WRF-Hydro. The forcing engine
# will map files to external variable names internally. For custom
# external native forcing files (see documenation), the code will
# expect a set of named variables to process. The following is a
# mapping of numeric values to external input native forcing files:
# 1 - NLDAS GRIB retrospective files
# 2 - NARR GRIB retrospective files
# 3 - GFS GRIB2 Global production files
# 4 - NAM Nest GRIB2 Conus production files
# 5 - HRRR GRIB2 Conus production files
# 6 - RAP GRIB2 Conus production files
# 7 - CFS GRIB2 Global production files
# 8 - WRF-ARW - GRIB2 Hawaii nest files
# 9 - Custom NetCDF forcing files
# 10 - Custom GRIB2 files
InputForcings = [3,4]

# Specify the input directories for each forcing product.
InputForcingDirectories = /Users/karsten/Desktop/testCase/GFS,
			  /Users/karsten/Desktop/testCase/NAM_nest

[Output]
# Specify the output frequency in minutes. 
# Note that any frequencies at higher intervals
# than what is provided as input will entail input
# forcing data being temporally interpolated.
OutputFrequency = 60

# Specify a top level output directory. For re-forecasts
# and forecasts, sub-directories for each forecast cycle
# will be generated. For retrospective processing, final
# output files will be placed in this directory. 
OutDir = /Users/karsten/Desktop/FORCING_TEST

[Retrospective]
# Specify to process forcings in retrosective mode
# 0 - No
# 1 - Yes
RetroFlag = 0

# Choose the beginning date of processing forcing files.
# NOTE - Dates are given in YYYYMMDDHHMM format
# If in real-time forecasting mode, leave as -9999.
# These dates get over-ridden in lookBackHours.
BDateProc = 201810010000
EDateProc = 201810020000

[Forecast]
# ONLY for realtime forecasting.
# - Specify a lookback period in minutes to process data.
#   This overrides any BDateProc/EDateProc options passed above.
#   If no LookBack specified, please specify -9999.
LookBack = 10725
#LookBack = -9999

# If running reforecasts, specify a window below. This will override 
# using the LookBack value to calculate a processing window. 
RefcstBDateProc = 200810010000
refcstEDateProc = 200910010000

# Specify a forecast frequency in minutes. This value specifies how often
# to generate a set of forecast forcings. If generating hourly retrospective
# forcings, specify this value to be 60. Also, Keep ForecastIntervals 
# below to be of zero length as no forecasts/reforecasts are generated. 
# Any input forcings that are not on the frequency will be interpolated.
ForecastFrequency = 360

# Forecast cycles are determined by splitting up a day by equal 
# ForecastFrequency interval. If there is a desire to shift the
# cycles to a different time step, ForecastShift will shift forecast
# cycles ahead by a determined set of minutes. For example, ForecastFrequency
# of 6 hours will produce forecasts cycles at 00, 06, 12, and 18 UTC. However,
# a ForecastShift of 1 hour will produce forecast cycles at 01, 07,
# 13, and 18 UTC. NOTE - This is only used by the realtime instance 
# to calculate forecast cycles accordingly. Re-forecasts will use the beginning
# and ending dates specified in conjunction with the forecast frequency
# to determine forecast cycle dates.  
ForecastShift = 0

# Specify how much of each input forcing is desires for each 
# forecast cycle. See documentation for examples. The length of
# this array must match the input forcing choices.
ForecastInputHorizons = [6,6]

# This option is for applying an offset to input forcings to use a different
# forecasted interval. For example, a user may wish to use 4-5 hour forecasted
# fields from an NWP grid from one of their input forcings. In that instance
# the offset would be 4 hours, but 0 for other remaining forcings. 
ForecastInputOffsets = [0,0]

[Geospatial]
# Specify a geogrid file that defines the WRF-Hydro (or NWM) domain to which
# the forcings are being processed to.
GeogridIn = /Users/karsten/Desktop/testCase/geo_FrnRngIOC_1km_NLCD11.nc

[Regridding]
# Choose regridding options for each input forcing files being used. Options available are:
# 1 - ESMF Bilinear
# 2 - ESMF Nearest Neighbor
# 3 - ESMF Conservative Bilinear
RegridOpt = [1,1]

[Downscaling]
# Choose downscaling options for each of the input forcing files. Downscaling options include:
# FILL IN DOWNSCALING OPTIONS HERE.....

# Specify the input parameter directory containing necessary downscaling grids.
DownscalingParamDir = /blah/blah

[BiasCorrection]
# Choose bias correction for each of the input forcing files. Bias correction options include:
# FILL IN BIAS CORRECTION HERE.....

[SuppForcing]
# Choose a set of supplemental precipitation file(s) to layer
# into the final LDASIN forcing files processed from
# the options above. The following is a mapping of
# numeric values to external input native forcing files:

# 1 - MRMS GRIB2 hourly radar-only QPE
# 2 - MRMS GRIB2 hourly gage-corrected radar QPE
# 3 - Stage IV hourly MPE
# 4 - Hourly National Water Model MPE NetCDF files.
# 5 - Custom hourly NetCDF MPE files
# 6 - Custom hourly GRIB2 MPE files
